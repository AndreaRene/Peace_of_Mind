# Peace of Mind

Peace of Mind is a website that will allow anyone with a need to connect to others regarding mental health and support. We provide a safe space for everyone to discuss their feelings without fear of retaliation.

Within this project, users have the ability to:

* Login or sign up to the site
* Make new posts
* Comment on posts
* Edit their own posts
* Delete their own posts

The application is fully responsive and even features a dark mode toggler in the bottom right corner. 

## Instalation

While Peace of mind was developed to use on a deployed website, you can certainly clone the repo. You will need to install the npm packages (npm i) and source the database in mysql(SOURCE db/schema.sql). Then you'll want to exit mysql(exit) run the seeds(npm run seed) before starting the server.
